|Notes|Points|Evidence|
|-----|------|---------|
| Video1 | 0 | N/A, no video showing new functionality. | 
| Video2 | 0 | N/A, no video showing new functionality. | 
| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot) | 2 | The workload seems unbalanced, with one person having contributed almost half of what everyone else has, https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/graphs/contributors |
|Number of commits| 3 | There are many commits by the team https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/graphs/commit-activity |
|Number of commits: by different people| 3 | The number of commits seems pretty even, exept for one person who committed multiple times more than everyone else, https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/graphs/contributors |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 0 | No issues have been created, https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/issues |
|Issues are being closed| 0 | No issues have been opened or closed, https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/issues |
|DOI badge: exists| 3 | https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15#readme |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 1 | Some documentation is available, but mostly just in the readme |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0 | There is not documentation about classes/functions outside of some code commments |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | There are no instructions or tutorials on project use |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | There is no compelling documentation to make a user want to use the software |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 0 | There is no video present |
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git was used for the project |
|Use of style checkers | 0 | There is no evidence of a style checker being used |
|Use of code formatters. | 0 | There is no evidence of code formatters being used |
|Use of syntax checkers. | 0 | There is no evidence of syntex checkers being used |
|Use of code coverage | 3 | https://app.codecov.io/gh/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15 |
|Other automated analysis tools| 0 | Not present. |
|Test cases exist (dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base)| 3 | There exists test cases https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/tree/main/test 
|Test cases are routinely executed (E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something) | 3 | Github actions was used for automated testing https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/actions|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 | https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed (even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here) | 0 | There are no issues on the project |
|Chat channel: exists (Link or screenshots)| 0 | No chat channel evidence |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.(If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it) | 0 | There are no issues in the project
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | There are no signs of different tools or issues the developers had
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | Seems that there weren't any issues |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | It looks like the whole team contributed on the same software stack
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | Some team members only contributed on a few different files in the code base https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/graphs/contributors |
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| 3 | Team members contributed and made commits often https://github.com/svengal03/SE_HW234_Team15/graphs/contributors |
