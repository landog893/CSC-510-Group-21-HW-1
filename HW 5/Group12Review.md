|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 2 | Documentation seems to be present, not sure how to access it. |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0 | Not sure how to open documentation, add instructions to ReadMe. |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | Not present. |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | Not present. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 0 | Not present. |

|Other automated analysis tools| 0 | Not present. |
|Test cases exist (dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base)| 3 | Exist in test folder. 
|Test cases are routinely executed (E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something) | 3 | https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/hw2/actions/workflows/main.yml|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 0 | File is empty. https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/hw2/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed (even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here) | 0 | Not present. |
|Chat channel: exists (Link or screenshots)| 0 | Not present. |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.(If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it) | 0 | Not present. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | Seems that there weren't any issues. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | Seems that there weren't any issues. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | Seems that there weren't any issues. |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | Some members contributed more than others,https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/hw2/graphs/contributors. |
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| 2 | Some members weren't contributing often enough. |
